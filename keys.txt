Associate two data tables using a foreign key column
determine which of the two tables you're associating together will take in a foreign key columnn

lets create a blogging platform
  :: we'd need a way to store data about different posts, as well as the post's authors.
          
  :: In this domain
you could say that an author has many posts 
The reciprocal of this would be that a post belongs to an author.

**figure out a way to represent that relationship within the constraints of a relational database

>> one-to-many relationship  i.e one author many posts
 use foreign key on the table of the record that belongs to a record in the other table

i.e put authors table with a primary key
    put posts table with a foreign key(author_id) to indicate that it belongs to a particluar author

  visualize this relationships using Entity Relationship Diagram
